# Blender Graphite Theme
This theme was originally based off the Blender Pro theme, yet built from the ground up to offer a more simplistic, modern view thats easy on the eyes. 

Important: This project is kind of a work in progress, though, there's not much to change or add. If a new version breaks the theme, i'll update it as soon as possible.
